What is Bigtop Routes?
----------------------

Routes is a library for creating bidirectional, type-safe mappings between URLs and code.

Routes will be presented in Dave's talk at [Scala Lift-Off London 2011]. Check his [Github page] for slides and code samples.

We will post the code and docs for Routes here very soon. Watch this space for further announcements!
